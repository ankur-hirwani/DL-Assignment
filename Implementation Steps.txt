Please follow the following steps to achieve Data Augmentation : 

1. Get the the data and store it the 'main' or 'root' folder. I have used the 'leaf.jpg' as the data.
2. Provide the reference to the data in DataAug.ipynb file as specified in the code.
3. Download and install the following dependencies : 
   a. Tensorflow
   b. Keras
   c. PIL
4. Run the code using Jupyter Notebook or any other ide.
5. The final result will be available in the AugData folder of the directory.
